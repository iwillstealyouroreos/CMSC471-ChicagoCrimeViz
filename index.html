        <h1>Chicago Crime Data Visualization</h1>

        <h5>
            For this assignment, I used the Chicago crime dataset from the City of Chicago's data portal. 
            This dataset contains detailed information about reported incidents of crime from 2001 to today. 
            My focus was on the rise and changes in crime from 2018 to 2022 to understand how the pandemic may 
            have impacted crime patterns.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            I focused on four key variables: 
            <ul>
                <li>The year the crime was reported (Year)</li>
                <li>The type of crime (Type)</li>
                <li>The district or location of the crime (District)</li>
                <li>Whether an arrest was made (Arrest)</li>
            </ul>
            These variables were used in dynamic filters for the year and district, as well as in tooltips.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            My goal was to explore how crime types evolved during the pandemic. I chose to use a TreeMap to visualize 
            the magnitude of crime reported. I also removed crime entries below a reasonable threshold to avoid overcrowding 
            and ensure meaningful insights. While I initially considered using geolocation data to create density or heatmaps, 
            I eventually focused on TreeMap visualization, which aligned better with my objectives.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            I also wanted to analyze crime data across different districts. This allows for comparison of crime patterns 
            in various areas and better insights into local trends.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            For the TreeMap implementation, I used the Chicago Crimes dataset along with techniques from 
            <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/treemap_basic.html" target="_blank">d3-graph-gallery</a>. 
            I also utilized transitions and initialization functions provided during class and lab.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            This project was completed individually, as most of my peers had already paired up. It was a challenging 
            experience, but I gained valuable insights. The data cleaning process took a significant amount of time 
            due to inconsistencies and missing data. Initially, I wanted to create spike maps using the geolocation data, 
            but it was poorly documented. After selecting the TreeMap visualization, I followed a helpful tutorial 
            and completed the implementation in 1-2 days.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            Overall, the project was a great learning experience. I had a lot of fun, but I would definitely 
            prefer working in a team for the next project to collaborate more effectively.
        </h5>

        <h5>
            AI Usage: I used CoPilot to assist with data cleaning strategies and guidance on adding the dyamic 
            filterization.
